## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2023 and 2024, focusing on analyzing traffic accident data. The dashboard would give important information to stakeholders and shape strategic policies to reduce accident casualties.

Some insights to be drawn were:
1. Total casualties post-accident.
2. Total casualties by accident severity and their percentage.
3. Total casualties with respect to vehicle type.
4. Monthly trend comparing casualties for the current and previous years.
5. Maximum casualties by road type, top 3.
6. Relationship between casualties on the basis of Area/Location and Day/Night.
